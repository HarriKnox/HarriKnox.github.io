		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a 19 year old university student studying robotics and prosthetics. I program as a hobby and have an affinity to computers and their inner mechanisms. My languages of choice are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<span>
						<a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>
						<br />
						A beautiful scripting language that is easy, fun, and safe for children six and up.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>
						<a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a>
						<br />
						Gigantic, bulky, and clumsy, but portable onto any platform, including toasters.
					</span>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>
						<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
						<br />
						The weird kid on the playground who wants to play games with everyone, but doesn't like everyone elses' rules and plays with too many unnecessary toys.
					</span>
				</li>
				<!--<li>
					<span>
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
						<br />
						The bastard lovechild of a horrendously verbose and difficult-to-read and write language, and Java.
					</span>
				</li>-->
			</ol>
			I am learning more languages. Currently I am working on HTML, JavaScript, AngularJS, and Ruby.
