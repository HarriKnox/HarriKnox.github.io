		<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to my GitHub Page</h1>
		<h3 style="text-align:center">Hello friends and family!<br/>My name is Harrison and I'm a programmer,<br/>not by trade but by nature.</h3>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I am a 19 year old university student studying robotics and prosthetics. I program as a hobby and have an affinity to computers and their inner mechanisms. My languages of choice are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>: a beautiful scripting language that is easy, fun, and safe for children six and up.</li>
				<li><a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a>: a gigantic, bulky, and clumsy, but portable onto any platform, including toasters.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>: the weird kid on the playground who wants to play games with everyone, but doesn't like everyone elses' rules and brings too many unnecessary toys.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>: the lovechild of a horrendously verbose, complex, and difficult-to-read and write language, and Java.</li>
			</ol>
			I am learning more languages. Currently I am learning HTML and JavaScript, particularly AngularJS.

				<li><a href="https://github.com/HarriKnox/lua_physics">lua_physics</a>: an experimental pure Lua basic physics calculator that keeps track of units and vectors, and contains a number of constants.</li>
