					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<hr />
					<p>
						My name is Harrison Knox.
						I am a 19 year old sophomore student at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> studying in Computer Engineering.
						I program as a hobby and have been programming for about eight years.
						In programming, my languages of choice are as follows:
						<ol type="I">
							<li><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>: a beautiful scripting language that is easy, fun, and safe for children six and up.</li>
							<li><a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a>: a gigantic, bulky, and clumsy, but portable onto any platform, including toasters.</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>: the weird kid on the playground who wants to play games with everyone, but doesn't like everyone elses' rules and brings too many unnecessary toys.</li>
							<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>: the lovechild of a horrendously verbose, complex, and difficult-to-read and write language, and Java.</li>
						</ol>
						I am learning more languages. Currently I am learning HTML and JavaScript, particularly AngularJS.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently I have been putting my projects online.
						Most of my projects and school assignments are viewable from the links in the navigation box to the left.
