				My name is Harrison Knox.
				I am a <span id="age"><noscript>19+</noscript></span> year old student at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> studying in Computer Engineering.
				I program as a hobby and have been programming for about eight years.
				In programming, my languages of choice are as follows:
				<ol type="I">
					<li><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>: a beautiful scripting language that is easy, fun, and safe for children six and up.</li>
					<li><a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a>: a gigantic, bulky, and clumsy language, but used on every platform, including toasters.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>: the weird kid on the playground who wants to play games with everyone, but doesn't like everyone elses' rules and brings too many unnecessary toys.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>: the lovechild of a horrendously verbose, complex, and difficult-to-read and write language, and Java.</li>
				</ol>
				I am learning more languages. Currently I am learning HTML and JavaScript, particularly AngularJS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recently I have been putting my projects online.
				Most of my projects and school assignments are viewable from the links in the navigation box to the left.
