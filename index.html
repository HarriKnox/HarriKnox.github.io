				My name is Harrison Knox.
				I am <span id="age"><noscript>19+</noscript></span> years old and a <span id="year"></span>student at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> majoring in Computer Engineering (CPE).
				I am studying in this field to go into robotics and prosthetics.

				This website has become a <em>blog</em> of sorts.
				In it, I will write about various programming languages and paradigms, cool math and science topics, and anything else that piques my interest.
				More or less, this is my forum on which I voice my opinions.
				Fear not, I will most likely not write about politics, religion, or anything else you don't want Uncle Benny bringing up during Thanksgiving dinner.

				Recently I have been putting my projects online.
				Most of my projects and school assignments are viewable from the links in the navigation box above.
