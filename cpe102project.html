			<div class="paragraph">
				One of the major courses for <abbr title="Computer Engineering">CPE</abbr> majors at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> is the class <abbr title="Computer Science">CSC</abbr> 102: Fundamentals of Computer Science.
				For our class project, all class members were to use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> to create a grid-based world simulation.
				The purpose of the project was an exercise in object-oriented programming, functional programming, and simple path-finding.
				You can view the source <a href="https://github.com/cchu1008/CPE102Project">here for the Pygame version</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cchu1008/CPE102ProjectJava">here for the Processing version</a>.

				<h2>Object-Oriented (OO) Programming</h2>
				<a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a> is a famous and ubiquitous OO language with support for functional programming.
				<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a famous OO and functional language.
				Using these two languages my classmates and I were given different flavors of OO programming in similar contexts.
