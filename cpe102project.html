			<div class="paragraph">
				One of the major courses for <abbr title="Computer Engineering">CPE</abbr> majors at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly</a> is the class <abbr title="Computer Science">CSC</abbr> 102: Fundamentals of Computer Science.
				For our class project, all class members were to use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">Pygame</a> and <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> to create a grid-based world simulation.
				The purpose of the project was an exercise in object-oriented programming, functional programming, and simple path-finding.
				You can view the source <a href="https://github.com/cchu1008/CPE102Project">here for the Pygame version</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cchu1008/CPE102ProjectJava">here for the Processing version</a>.

				<h2 class="content-header">Object-Oriented (OO) Programming</h2>
				<a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a> is a famous and ubiquitous OO language with support for functional programming.
				<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is a famous OO and functional language.
				Using these two languages my classmates and I were given different flavors of OO programming in similar contexts.
				For the first part of our project, our professor provided us with dirty and repetitive Python code.
				The code was of a Pygame project that simulated a small, grid-based world with various moving and interacting entities.
				The code was mostly functional: only a few classes existed.
				There were helper classes that were given to us (such as <code>Point</code> and <code>Ordered_list</code>), but there were also the entity classes, which only held data and had no behavior for themselves.

				<h3 class="content-header">Step One: From Functional to Prototype</h3>
				Our first task was to move functionality into all of the individual entity classes.
				The behavior of each entity was defined in an external function.
