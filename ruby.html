			<p>
				If Python and Ruby were real humans, they would be bitter rivals.
				While Python prides itself on being concise and having one way to do something, Ruby prides itself on being as unnecessarily redundant as it can possibly be.
				Ruby's mantra is essentially "There should be multiple ways to do it".
				There are <code>if</code> and its complement <code>unless</code>, <code>while</code> and its complement <code>until</code>.
				There are lambdas, procs, and blocks, and each has its own differences.
				There are hashes, classes, and modules, which act like Lua tables and Python classes combined.
				There are five types of loops:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin:0px">
				<li><code>(int).times{}</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times</li>
				<li><code>(list/hashmap).each{}</code> for iterating over every element of an iterable</li>
				<li><code>for</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times or over every element of an iterable</li>
				<li><code>while</code> for iterating indefinitely</li>
				<li><code>until</code> for iterating not indefinitely enough</li>
			</ul>

				I am not a fan of Ruby.
				Most of this may come from ignorance and my lack of experience with the language, but from what I've seen I don't particulary enjoy nor understand Ruby.
