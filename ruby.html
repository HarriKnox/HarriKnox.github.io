			<div class="paragraph">
				<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> is a multiparadigm scripting language, primarily object-oriented (OO) and functional.
				Ruby was designed to be intelligible by humans and not just by machines.
				Most languages use strict syntax so the computer will understand what its instructions are.
				Ruby, on the other hand, uses English syntax to aid in readability and has numerous techniques to do something to aid in compehensibility.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				I am an advocate of removing unnecessary syntax: I don't like having a million ways to do something.
				Because of that, I am not a big fan of Ruby.
				There is a lot to Ruby that I don't know and don't understand, but from what I know I don't particularly take to it.
				That being said, I am not saying to not learn Ruby: quite the opposite.
				Ruby is one of the languages everyone in programming should learn.
				It is used in web development (<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>) and is available on most major platforms.
				I tried it out of curiosity and don't like it, but that doesn't mean you won't like it either.

				<h2 class="content-header">Features of Ruby</h2>
				Before jumping into what I don't like about Ruby, I think it's only fair to write about all the features the language offers.
				Primarily I will focus on what the language has that most languages don't have.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h3 class="content-header">Data Types Galore</h3>
				I love Lua, and as such, I am used to everything being a table.
				Ruby, however, takes a more Pythonic approach to various data types.
				Ruby has hashes, classes, and modules, which parallel Python's dicts, classes, and classes (again).
				Dictionaries in Python, hashes in Ruby, and tables in Lua are all rather similar: a set of key-value pairs.
				Lua does not have a concept of classes, but Ruby and Python do.
				The classes allow you to create copious instances of them and extend other classes.
				Ruby takes things a step further by adding modules, which are essentially static classes that can be implemented by any class.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h3 class="content-header">Symbols</h3>
				Ruby provides a special data type called a symbol.
				In normal OO languages, objects are unique and multiple clones may not point to the same location.
				They are convenient as keys in hashes and method names because of their uniqueness and immuatbility.
				For example, I did the following
			</div>
<pre>
a = "This is a string"
b = "This is a string"
puts "a object_id = " &lt;&lt; a.object_id.to_s    #=&gt; a object_id = 74149330
puts "b object_id = " &lt;&lt; b.object_id.to_s    #=&gt; b object_id = 74149320
puts (a.object_id == b.object_id).to_s       #=&gt; false
</pre>
			<div class="paragraph">
				The two object ids differ, not by much, but they differ.
				Even though the two strings are the same, they refer to different objects.
				Symbols, written like <code>:symbol_name</code> evaluate to themselves.
				All symbols of the same name accross a Ruby program have the exact same object_id.
			</div>
<pre>
a = :symbol_name
b = :symbol_name
puts "a object_id = " &lt;&lt; a.object_id.to_s    #=&gt; a object_id = 146968
puts "b object_id = " &lt;&lt; b.object_id.to_s    #=&gt; b object_id = 146968
puts (a.object_id == b.object_id).to_s       #=&gt; true
</pre>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h3 class="content-header">Sigils</h3>
				Ruby also has what are called sigils.
				In some languages, like Perl, sigils appear next to variable names to indicate the type of the value <span style="white-space:nowrap">(<code>$</code></span> indicates the value is a scaler, <code>@</code> indicates it's an array, etc).
				In Ruby, they indicate the return value of a method.
				One sigil that I wished was in Lua is the query sigil <code>?</code>.
				The query comes at the end of a method name to indicate it's a predicate (returns a boolean).
				This makes the code look a bit more like English.
				For example: <code>"some string".includes? "t"</code> reads like "does 'some string' include 't'?", to which the answer is 'yes'.
				Another sigil is the bang sigil <code>!</code>.
				The bang follows a method name to indicate the method is a "dangerous" method, one that affects the object in question and does not merely return a new object.
				Take the following:
			</div>
<pre>
# no bang
a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
b = a.sort
puts a.to_s    #=&gt; [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
puts b.to_s    #=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# with a bang
a = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
b = a.sort!
puts a.to_s    #=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
puts b.to_s    #=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>

				<h2 class="content-header">Why Ruby Isn't my Cup of Tea</h2>
				If Python and Ruby were real humans, they would be bitter rivals: Python prides itself on being concise and having one way to do something, Ruby prides itself on being as redundant as it can possibly be.
				Like I said, I don't like having a million ways to do something; I like things to be a bit less chaotic.
				It seems like Matz (creator of Ruby) said to himself "I wonder if this should be put in" and never said no: it's not if he should, but if he could.
				There are many instances in Ruby where there are various means to achieve the same thing.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h3 class="content-header">Matz's Third Law:</h3>
				<h4 style="margin:0px 3em;">for every keyword, there is an equal and opposite re-keyword</h4>
				For example, just like any language there is the <code>if ...</code> statement, but there is its complement <code>unless ...</code> which the same as <code>if not ...</code>.
				There is <code>while ...</code> and also <code>until ...</code>, identical to <code>while not ...</code>.
				For these, I can sort of understand why there are the complements.
				Ruby is designed for readability, and sometimes it is easier for some to say "unless you're tired, run" instead of "if you're not tired, run".
				I'd still opt for the latter.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				There are lambdas, procs, and blocks, and each has its own differences.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				There are also five types of loops:
				<ul>
					<li><code>(int).times{}</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times</li>
					<li><code>(list/hash).each{}</code> for iterating over every element of an iterable</li>
					<li><code>for</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times or over every element of an iterable</li>
					<li><code>while</code> for iterating indefinitely</li>
					<li><code>until</code> for iterating not indefinitely enough</li>
				</ul>
