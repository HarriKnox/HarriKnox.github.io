			<p>The following are the various languages I have picked up over the years of programming. My favorite language is Lua, with Java and JS coming second and third. Beyond that I have passionate disdain for a few select languages (namely Ruby and Python).</p>
			<p>
				<h2 class="lang"><a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a></h2>
				Lua is a beautiful and simple scripting language that is safe for children six and up.
				It is easy to learn with simple syntax and no unnecessary rubbish.
				Without a doubt it is my absolute favorite language.
				There are a few downsides to Lua, but nothing that is too major.
				<!--Lua is somewhat of a multiparadigm language with support for functional and object-oriented programming (OO).
				Functions are first-class citizens in Lua, thus the functional programmers can rejoice.
				Lua, however, does not support OO like some common OO languages like Java and Ruby.
				Lua utilizes the prototype model for objects.
				All complex data types in Lua are tables (hashmaps, or key-value pairs).
				Using tables, one could emulate an object, giving it field and method names (keys) with their associated values (values).
				Lua then has a system of metatables to control the inheritance chain.-->
			</p>

				<h2 class="lang"><a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a></h2>
				Everyone knows what Java is: it's a ubiquitous OO language that requires you to write twenty lines to print "Hello World".
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2 class="lang"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></h2>
				JavaScript is like taking the scripting principles and prototype model of Lua and the syntax of Java to make an ugly baby that grew to its current popularity and became ruler of the internet.
				Aside from the syntax and a few core language specific differences (like the lack of a exponent operator in JS, native threading support in Lua, and variable declaration discrepancies), JavaScript and Lua are remarkably similar.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2 class="lang"><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></h2>
				Python is another scripting language like Lua, with a few OO features, native arbitrary precision, the <code>continue</code> keyword, and list comprehension, but with indentation that matters, no anonymous multi-line functions, spaces instead of tabs, confusing parentheses, and much more.
				Python's mantra is more-or-less "<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it</a>" which ultimately translates to "it's my way or the highway".
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2 class="lang"><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a></h2>
				If Python and Ruby were real humans, they would be bitter enemies.
				While Python prides itself on being concise and having one way to do something, Ruby prides itself on being as unnecessarily redundant as it can possibly be.
				Ruby's mantra is essentially "There should be multiple ways to do it".
				There are <code>if</code> and its complement <code>unless</code>, <code>while</code> and its complement <code>until</code>.
				There are lambdas, procs, and blocks, and each has its own differences.
				There are hashes, classes, and modules, which act like Lua tables and Python classes combined.
				There are five types of loops:
				<ul style="margin:0px">
					<li><code>(int).times{}</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times</li>
					<li><code>(list/hashmap).each{}</code> for iterating over every element of an iterable</li>
					<li><code>for</code> for iterating something a definitive number of times or over every element of an iterable</li>
					<li><code>while</code> for iterating indefinitely</li>
					<li><code>until</code> for iterating not indefinitely enough</li>
				</ul>
				I am not a fan of Ruby.
				Most of this may come from ignorance and my lack of experience with the language, but from what I've seen I don't particulary enjoy nor understand Ruby.

				<h2 class="lang"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">HTML</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a></h2>
				HTML and CSS are cool. No complaints.
