         <div>
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a> is a beautiful and simple scripting language that is safe, easy, and fun for the whole family: easy to learn with simple syntax and no unnecessary rubbish.
            It is lightweight and portable: as the fastest interpreted language it is also runnable on all OSes (computer and phone) and embeddable in many applications.
            It is a multi-paradigm language, featuring support for functional and object-oriented (prototype-based) programming.
            Despite differences in syntax, Lua and <a href="programming/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> are remarkably similar.
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
            Functions are first-class citizens in Lua.
            Like most functional languages, functions are values that can be passed between function calls, assigned to variables, and called recursively.
            In Lua, functions can be passed anonymously, called recursively, created in closures, and used as keys for tables.
            These are not unique to Lua, but the freedom to the usage of functions in Lua makes them pretty powerful and pretty darn cool.
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>Object Oriented (OO) Programming</h2>
            Lua has basic support for OO-like programming, but not like common OO languages like Java and Ruby.
            In Java, the class is a model of all the attributes its instances will have, and all instances of a class will have exactly those specified attributes.
            Lua, however, relies on the Prototype-Based model, like JavaScript.
            In Lua, all complex data types are tables (essentially a Map in Java, a Hash in Ruby, a Dictionary in Python and other languages), which are key-value pairs.
            In prototype-based design, there are no classes <em>per se</em>.
            Every object is its own bundle of data and can have whatever attributes it wants, though you can emulate the concept of a class by defining default values for various attributes.
            This would mean that for every time you wanted to "extend" a class (which would just be another object), you would have to clone the entire object, so every attribute name and value would be put into your new object.
            Thankfully, Lua has a built-in system to manage the inheritance-chain.
         </div>
         <div>
            What Lua uses is called a <em>metatable</em>.
            A metatable affects the behavior of the table itself rather than the behavior inside the table.
            In Java, classes define the behavior inside an object: how the object manipulates and uses the data inside of it.
            In Lua, tables can still do that, but the metatables affect how Lua manipulates and uses certain tables.
            Using the <code>_index</code> metamethod in a table's metatable, you can point Lua to a different table if the first table doesn't have a value Lua's looking for.
            For example, take the following code:
         </div>
<pre>
Vehicle = { speed = 50, vroom = "vroom" }
Motorcycle = { vroom = "VROOM!" }
Car = { speed = 80 }
</pre>
         <div>
            If you tried to get the values of <code>Car.vroom</code> and <code>Motorcycle.speed</code> you'd get <code>nil</code> both times.
            That's because each of the three tables are completely separate and different tables.
            Lua doesn't know they're related to each other yet.
            To do that, you'd need to do the following:
         </div>
<pre>
metavehicle = { __index = Vehicle }
setmetatable( Motorcycle, metavehicle )
</pre>
         <div>
            In the first line, we're creating a regular table with one field, <code>__index = Vehicle</code> (<code>Vehicle</code> is referring to the <code>Vehicle</code> table from the previous set of code).
            In the second line, we set the metatable for <code>Motorcycle</code> to <code>metavehicle</code>.
            Now if you were to do <code>Motorcycle.speed</code> it would return <code>50</code>.
            Because we did this for only <code>Motorcycle</code> and not for <code>Car</code>, doing <code>Car.vroom</code> will still return <code>nil</code>.
            To add <code>Car</code> to the family, simply run <code>setmetatable( Car, metavehicle )</code>.
         </div>
         <div>
            What's happening behind the scenes is rather interesting.
            Before setting the metatable, when we tried to call <code>Motorcycle.speed</code> this happened:
            <ol>
               <li>Lua looked in <code>Motorcycle</code> for <code>speed</code> and couldn't find it</li>
               <li>Lua gave up and returned <code>nil</code></li>
            </ol>
            After setting the metatable for <code>Motorcycle</code>, if we tried to call <code>Motorcycle.speed</code>, the following happens:
            <ol>
               <li>Lua looked in <code>Motorcycle</code> for <code>speed</code> and couldn't find it</li>
               <li>Lua saw that <code>Motorcycle</code> had a metatable</li>
               <li>Lua looked in the metatable for <code>__index</code> and saw it was a table (<code>Vehicle</code>)</li>
               <li>Lua looked in <code>Vehicle</code> for <code>speed</code> and found it</li>
               <li>Lua got the value of <code>Vehicle.speed</code> and returned <code>50</code></li>
            </ol>
            Just by specifying an <code>__index</code> you can define inheritance.
         </div>
         <div>
            It gets better.
            A table with a metatable that has <code>__index</code> can be pointed to by another metatable with its own <code>__index</code>, so you can chain inheritances as you go further down.
            Suppose we added a <code>Ducati</code> as a child of <code>Motorcycle</code>, we just do:
         </div>
<pre>
metamotorcycle = { __index = Motorcycle }
Ducati = {}
setmetatable( Ducati, metamotorcycle )
</pre>
         <div>
            You can also have a table be its own metatable, with its <code>__index</code> metamethod pointing to its parent class.
            You can also have a table be a metatable for other tables and have its <code>__index</code> metamethod point to itself.
         </div>
<pre>
-- Motorcycle as its own metatable

Motorcycle.__index = Vehicle
setmetatable( Motorcycle, Motorcycle )
</pre>
<pre>
-- Vehicle's __index pointing to itself

Vehicle.__index = Vehicle
setmetatable( Motorcycle, Vehicle )
</pre>
         <div>
            There are a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.4">ton of other metamethods</a> that are too numerous to elaborate on here.
            Metatables make Lua about as close to OO without being OO.
         </div>
         <div>
            <h2>An Annoying Gotcha</h2>
            Lua is almost the perfect language, but there is one thing that bugs me about it: <code>0</code> is not falsy (that is, it does not fail a conditional).
            It would be convenient if <code>0</code> failed.
            Adding that feature would make checks for empty strings and empty tables a tad more eloquent.
            For example, it would be nicer for <code>if #arg then parse() else error() end</code> to error if nothing was passed to the script in the command line.
            You could also do <code>if not #(io.read()) ...</code> to execute something if nothing was read in.
         </div>
         <div>
            This decision is most likely because of Lua's background.
            Though Lua was built on ANSI C, it had influences from Lisp (specifically Scheme, one of two main Lisp dialects/families).
            Historically, in Lisp values were either <code>NIL</code> or not.
            Thus, in Lua, values were either <code>nil</code> or not: the only thing that would evaluate to false was <code>nil</code>.
            Then with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.0">Lua 5.0</a> in 2003, booleans were added so that <code>false</code> wasn't exactly <code>nil</code>, and <code>true</code> wasn't exactly a meaningful data value, but both would evaluate to their approximates in conditionals.
            In the addition of <code>false</code> it makes sense that <code>0</code> was just simply overlooked.
         </div>
         <div>
            One argument I read against this was that it would break the canonical Lua ternary conditional operator when using a zero in it.
            In this contrived scenario, suppose your code was <code>x = math.random() &lt; 0.5 and 0 or 1</code>.
            That line would assign <code>x</code> randomly to either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> with equal weight; however, if <code>0</code> was falsy, the <code>and</code> will always fail and <code>x</code> will always be <code>1</code> regardless of the random number generator output.
            That problem, though, is easily fixed by switching the outputs: <code>x = math.random() &lt; 0.5 and 1 or 0</code>.
            This code would work perfectly fine because when Lua short-circuits <code>or</code> operators, if all values are falsy it returns the last value; thus, if <code>math.random() &lt; 0.5</code> failed, it will fail again at <code>0</code> but return <code>0</code> anyway.
            That problem is easily fixable in small projects, but not as easily for large libraries: especially ones that are years old and no longer regularly maintained.
            To avoid breaking everything and pissing off much of the Lua community, the Lua devs are keeping <code>0</code> truthy.

            <h3>Getting Table Size</h3>
            Second is that there is no way to get the size of a table, only the length of a number-indexed array.
            If you had the table <code>a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [7] = 10}</code>, then <code>#a</code> would return <code>5</code>, even though there are 6 elements in the table.
            To get the total number of elements in the table, you'd have to iterate through it using <code>for k, v in pairs(a) count = count + 1 end</code>.
            Perhaps a table function or an operator like <code>$a</code> or <code>&amp;a</code> to return the total number of elements in the table would be nice.
         </div>
         <div>
            <h3>Sigils</h3>
            Third is that there can be no question mark in variable names.
            This is only a case in which I'm envious of Ruby.
            Ruby has methods that end with a question mark to indicate that the method returns a boolean.
            Something like that would be nice so function and method names in Lua would look a bit more English.
