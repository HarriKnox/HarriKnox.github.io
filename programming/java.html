				<a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> is the language everyone loves to hate.
				It was designed to be the safety version of C++, like those rounded scissors children have to use in school.
				Java is an object-oriented (OO) programming language with verbose syntax, redundant code, and repetative structure: it features static data typing, access modifiers, extensive libraries, data abstraction, structured class definitions, and safety systems, all to ensure you don't screw up your own code.
				Jokes aside, Java is a powerful language that does not compile to machine code but to Java Bytecode, which is then run by a Java Virtual Machine, allowing Java to be written anywhere, compiled anywhere, and run anywhere.

				<h2 class="content-header">Your Friend the JVM</h2>
				Java is one of the most well-known languages, primarily because it's available on everything: computers, phones, printers, toasters, you name it.
				The reason for this is because Java's compiling is platform independent.
				Most compiled languages compile to assembler code or machine code, instructions for the CPU to perform specific tasks, like read from a particular memory address or perform an arithmetic operation on some bytes of data.
				Assembler code and machine code are architecture-specific, meaning they are tied to the motherboard, graphics card, CPU, RAM, and everything else in your computer.
				Because of this, some programs written in compiled languages need to be compiled for each computer they run on: this is where Java shines.
				Java does not compile to machine or assembler, it compiles to Java bytecode, which is run by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
				A virtual machine is a program that emulates a physical computer all the way down to the architectural level.
				A JVM is just that, but follows the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/">Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>, an abstract definition of a virtual machine where the Java bytecode is its machine code.
