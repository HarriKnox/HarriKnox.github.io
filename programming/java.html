				<a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> is the language everyone loves to hate.
				It was designed to be the safety version of C++, like those rounded scissors children have to use in school.
				Java is an object-oriented (OO) programming language with verbose syntax, redundant code, and repetative structure: it features static data typing, access modifiers, extensive libraries, data abstraction, and structured class definitions: all to ensure you don't screw up your own code.
				Jokes aside, Java is a powerful language that does not compile to machine code but to Java Bytecode, which is then run by a Java Virtual Machine, allowing Java to be written anywhere, compiled anywhere, and run anywhere.

				<h2>Your Friend the JVM</h2>
				Java is one of the most well-known languages, primarily because it's available on everything: computers, phones, printers, toasters, you name it.
				The reason for this is because Java's compiling is platform independent.
				Most compiled languages compile to assembler code or machine code, instructions for the CPU to perform specific tasks, like read from a particular memory address or perform an arithmetic operation on some bytes of data.
				Assembler code and machine code are architecture-specific, meaning they are tied to the motherboard, graphics card, CPU, RAM, and everything else in your computer.
				Because of this, some programs written in compiled languages need to be compiled for each computer they run on: this is where Java shines.
				Java does not compile to machine or assembler, it compiles to Java bytecode, which is run by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
				A virtual machine is a program that emulates a physical computer all the way down to the architectural level.
				A JVM is just that, but follows the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/">Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>, an abstract definition of a virtual machine where the Java bytecode is its machine code.

				<h2>The Many "Safety Features" of Java</h2>
				Java was designed in the aftermath of C++ to contain all the object-orientedness of C++ without all the dangerous, abusable capabilities like operator overloading, lazy evaluation, inferred data typing, and functional programming.
				Java instead has numerous features to reduce the chances of rapid and spontaneous code destruction.

				<h3>Strict Data Typing Rules</h3>
				Java is what is called <em>strongly typed</em>.
				The actual definition of <em>strongly typed</em> is non-existant, but it's used colloquially and understood by pretty much everyone.
				<em>Strongly typed</em> really just means "more strict than weakly typed" and <em>weakly typed</em> really just means "less strict than strongly typed": there are no absolutes, only comparisons.
				The basic idea behind a strongly typed language is that objects, when passed around, can reliably be compatible with an expected data type: that is, an object passed to a function will be of a compatible type to the type expected by the receiving function.
				In Java you declare the types of each parameter and can expect either an object of that type or a subtype, which brings me to the key features in Java's type system: manifests and names
				Java uses both a Manifest Type system and a Nominative Type system.
				The Manifest Type system enforces that programmers explicitly declare the type of the variable at some point during or before initialization: in <code>double size; Color color;</code> both <em>double</em> and <em>Color</em> are the manifests.
				In the Nominative Type system, objects are considered compatible if they share the same class, not just share the same structure.
				In Java, an ArrayList is a List, so an object of type ArrayList is compatible where either an ArrayList or List is expected.
				In contrast, some languages just expect certain methods or fields to be present to establish compatibility.
				For example, an object of type ArrayList and another object of type HashMap have similar methods (<code>clear</code>, <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>size</code>).
				In a dynamic language, like Lua or Python, both objects could be cleared since they both have the <code>clear</code> method, but in Java, since the two objects do not have the same classes, they are incompatible.
