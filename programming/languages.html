				I have been programming for about eight years.
				It started as a hobby and now I am studying it in university.
				The following are the various languages I have picked up over the years of programming.
				My favorite language is Lua, with Java and JS coming second and third.
				Beyond that I have passionate disdain for a few select languages (namely Ruby and Python).

				JavaScript is like taking the scripting principles and prototype model of Lua and the syntax of Java to make an ugly baby that grew to its current popularity and became ruler of the internet.
				Aside from the syntax and a few core language specific differences (like the lack of a exponent operator in JS, native threading support in Lua, and variable declaration discrepancies), JavaScript and Lua are remarkably similar.

				<h2><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></h2>
				Python is another scripting language like Lua, with a few OO features, native arbitrary precision, the <code>continue</code> keyword, and list comprehension, but with indentation that matters, no anonymous multi-line functions, spaces instead of tabs, confusing parentheses, and much more.
				Python's mantra is more-or-less "<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it</a>" which ultimately translates to "it's my way or the highway".

				HTML and CSS are cool. No complaints.
