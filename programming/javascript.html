			<div class="paragraph">
				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the <em>language of browsers</em>: every internet browser more-or-less supports it in some way.
				The general trend with web developers is to hate JavaScript with no remorse, but I quite like JavaScript and find it a lovely scripting language with wonderful scripting features, just plagued with the syntax of Java: first-class functions, closures, prototypes, and curly braces and semicolons everywhere!
				Besides the syntax, a few other minor differences in core features (for example, the presence of IO and multithreading), and variable scoping, JavaScript is almost identical to <a href="programming/lua.html">Lua</a>, which I am not ashamed to say is my absolute favorite language.
				Technically speaking, JavaScript and Java have nothing in common beside the name, which was probably used as a marketing ploy in the wake of the Java Hype of the late 1990s.

				<h2>Engines</h2>
				JavaScript itself isn't just a language but an implementation of the <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript Specification</a>: specifically Mozilla's implementation.
				There are various other implementations of ECMAScript that run on <em>engines</em>, internal code to interpret and execute JavaScript code.
				Mozilla's engine is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projectsc/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a>, the first ECMAScript engine to be created and the unofficial "industry standard".
				In developing SpiderMonkey, the engineers at Mozilla attempt to implement the more difficult ECMAScript features to provide an example for other engine developers.
				There are multiple other engines, most for the various browsers: there is V8 for Chrome, Chakra for Opera, JSctipt for Internet Explorer, Rhino for Java projects, and many more.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				For the most part, every engine operates the same way: JavaScript code you write will be compatible with all engines.
				Each engine is unique, however, and they differ primarily in their support of various minor ECMAScript features (for example, some engines support the <code>let</code> keyword, others don't).
				Besides the minor and more obscure feature differences, every engine supports the main specifications so there shouldn't be any worry about compatibility.
