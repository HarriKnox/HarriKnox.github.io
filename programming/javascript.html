				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the <em>language of browsers</em> as every internet browser supports it in some way.
				It is a lovely scripting language with the Script features of Lua but the Java syntax of Java: first-class functions, closures, prototypes, and curly braces and semicolons everywhere!
				I am a fan of scripting languages, in particular <a href="programming/lua.html">Lua</a>.
				Lua shares many features with JavaScript (as will be elaborated on later in this page), thus I have a fondness in JavaScript as well.

				Technically speaking, JavaScript and Java have nothing in common beside the name, which was probably used as a marketing ploy in the wake of the Java Hype of the late 1990's.
				JavaScript is also technically not just a language, but an implementation of the <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript Specification</a>.
				While we're being as technical as we are, Mozilla browsers are the only browsers that actually run JavaScript since Mozilla develops JavaScript.
				All browsers have use a JavaScript engine, and the engine Mozilla uses is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a>; all other browsers use different engines which are compliant with various versions and features of ECMAScript.
