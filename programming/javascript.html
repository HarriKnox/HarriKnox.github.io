				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the <em>language of browsers</em> as every internet browser supports it in some way.
				It is a lovely scripting language with the Script features of Scheme and Lua but the Java syntax of Java: first-class functions, closures, prototypes, and curly braces and semicolons everywhere!
				Technically speaking, the language is called <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript</a> and JavaScript is just a dialect of it.
