				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the <em>language of browsers</em>: every internet browser more-or-less supports it in some way.
				The general trend with web developers is to hate JavaScript with no remorse, but I quite like JavaScript and find it a lovely scripting language with wonderful scripting features, just plagued with the syntax of Java: first-class functions, closures, prototypes, and curly braces and semicolons everywhere!
				Besides the syntax, a few other minor differences in core features (for example, the presence of IO and multithreading), and variable scoping, JavaScript is almost identical to <a href="programming/lua.html">Lua</a>, which I am not ashamed to say is my absolute favorite language.
				Technically speaking, JavaScript and Java have nothing in common beside the name, which was probably used as a marketing ploy in the wake of the Java Hype of the late 1990s.

				JavaScript is owned and developed by Mozilla and is Mozilla's implementation of the <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript Specification</a>.
                There are various implementations of ECMAScript called <em>engines</em>, internal code to interpret and execute JavaScript code.
				Every major browser has its own implementation of ECMAScript: Chrome uses V8, Opera uses Chakra, and Internet Explorer uses JSctipt among others.

				Every internet browser has a JavaScript engine (internal code to interpret and execute JavaScript), which really is an ECMAScript engine.
                Mozilla owns and develops <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a>, the first JavaScript engine.
                There's also V8 (for Chrome, Safari, and other WebKit browsers) and Chakra (for Opera) and quite a few other engines for other browsers, command-line interpreters, and embedded scripting functionality in programs.
