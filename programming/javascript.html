				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the <em>language of browsers</em> as every internet browser supports it in some way.
				It is a lovely scripting language with the Script features of Lua but the Java syntax of Java: first-class functions, closures, prototypes, and curly braces and semicolons everywhere!
				I am a fan of scripting languages, especially functional languages
				
				Technically speaking, JavaScript and Java have nothing in common beside the name, which was probably used as a marketing ploy in the wake of the Java Hype of the late 1990's.
				JavaScript is technically not just a language, but an implementation of the <a href="http://www.ecmascript.org/">ECMAScript Specification</a>.
				While we're being technical, Mozilla browsers are the only browsers that actually run JavaScript since Mozilla owns and develops JavaScript and the Mozilla JavaScript engine is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a>; all other browsers use different engines which (individually) are compliant with ECMAScript.
