            This is a free Ticket to Ride score calculator, built in JS to be run on any browser and simple to use.
            First, count up the number of 1-length tracks claimed by a player and input that number in the appropriate box.
            Repeat for the rest of the lengths and the rest of the players.
            Second, write a space-separated list of the numerical values of each destination ticket completed (and not completed) in the appropriate boxes.
            Third (and optional), write a space-separated list of numbers to add to or subtract from a player's score (not used in the main game, but here for house rules).
