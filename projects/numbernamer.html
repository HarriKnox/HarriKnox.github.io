				Having learned the Lisp-like language Clojure I decided to revisit my Number Namer project I did in Lua and improve it with the magical abilities of nested parentheses.
				This project would take a number and return the English name for it.
				For example, 8'675'309 would return the string <em>eight million, six hundred seventy-five thousand, three hundred nine</em>.
				Then, using the ClojureScript compiler, I made the script executable in web browsers everywhere; thus anybody can enjoy naming their favorite numbers, big or small.

				<h2>The Rectangles</h2>
				The following two input boxes return the group-name for a given group-number, and the number's full name.
				These input fields take positive integers only (for right now, at least) meaning you cannot put decimals, negatives, or non-number characters like letters or punctuation.
				If you choose to not do those, the rectangle will complain.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Number to String</h3>
				In this rectangle put the number you would like to know the full name of.
			</div>
			<div class="number-to-string-div"></div>
			<div class="documentation">
				<div class="doc-title">number_to_string</div>
				<code>io.harriknox.NumberName.number_to_string(value)</code>
				<h4>Parameters:</h4>
				<code>value</code> is either an int or string representation of a non-negative integer
				<h4>Returns:</h4>
				the number's full name in English as a string
				<h4>Throws:</h4>
				assertion exceptions if input is invalid
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Group Name</h3>
				In this rectangle put the group number you want to know the Latin name of.
				Strictly speaking, a group-number is one less than the number of three-digit groups following the group in question: in 1'000'000'000'000 (a trillion) the group with 1 is followed by four three-digit groups, four minus one is three, thus <strong>tri</strong>llion.
				Group-numbers and group-names are explained in more depth on my <a href="projects/bignumbers.html">Big Numbers</a> page, so have a look there if you would like to enlighten yourself.
			</div>
			<div class="illion-group-name-div"></div>
			<div class="documentation">
				<div class="doc-title">illion_group_name</div>
				<code>io.harriknox.NumberName.illion_group_name(grpNum)</code>
				<h4>Parameters:</h4>
				<code>grpNum</code> is either an int or string representation of a positive integer
				<h4>Returns:</h4>
				the corresponding Latin group-name for the group number as a string
				<h4>Throws:</h4>
				assertion exceptions if input is invalid
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Powers of Ten</h3>
				In this rectangle put the quantity of digits in the number you want to know the Latin name of.
				For example, if you wanted to know what a googol was (10<sup>100</sup>) put 100.
				The maximum value you can put into this and get a reliable result is 9007199254740991.
				Beyond that number there is no guarantee you will get the number you want.
			</div>
			<div class="power-of-ten-div"></div>
			<div class="documentation">
				<div class="doc-title">power_of_10_to_string</div>
				<code>io.harriknox.NumberName.power_of_10_to_string(exp)</code>
				<h4>Parameters:</h4>
				<code>exp</code> is either an int or string representation of an integer in the range [0, 9007199254740991]
				<h4>Returns:</h4>
				the number's full name in English as a string
				<h4>Throws:</h4>
				assertion exceptions if input is invalid
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>The Method</h2>
				I first built the project in Lua when its purpose was much more simple than it is now.
				In the Lua project I had no intention of exceding numbers greater than 999.
				When I did need to exceed 999, I just had a second function to split the six-digit number into two groups, get the names of each group, and concatenate the names together with "thousand" added between the groups.
				Those were the days.
			</div>
			<div>
				Then, I learned a cool new programming language called Clojure.
