				Big numbers are a fantastic study in mathematics.
				Numbers themselves are quite weird: they are an abstract concept that we can visualize concretely.
				If I say "seven" it really doesn't mean anything, but you might picture seven amorphous blobs in your head.
				If I say "seven is greater than two" you nod because your abstraction-comprehending brain-matter understands my assertion.
				If I show you a bowl with seven balls and a bowl with two balls, your concrete brain can understand the one with seven has more.
				Abstraction is sometimes difficult to understand because the idea is (excuse my circular logic) abstract, but the lack of a physical object makes big numbers more fun; as numbers get bigger, they start to break our understanding of this simple concept called counting.
			</div>

				Thinking of ten or a hundred people is somewhat easy; you could probably name that many people if you saw their faces.
				Counting to larger numbers, though, gets a bit tricky.
				A hundred groups of a hundred people each is a little harder to imagine, but that's ten thousand people, about a thousand less than the number of Cal Poly students in Spanos Stadium watching their men's soccer team beat UCSB's soccer team.
				Counting to even larger numbers becomes more mind-boggling: a hundred Spanos Stadiums filled with excited Cal Poly students is hard to visualize, and that's only a million.

				You may have seen a million discrete objects: a standard 1080p monitor has about two million pixels which is pretty easy to see collectively.
				But, you have never seen a billion discrete objects, so picturing a billion things at once is near impossible.
				We know there are about a trillion stars in the Andromeda galaxy, but we can't accurately imagine that.
				All these big numbers are abstract, but even when abstract, big numbers are still pretty neat.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Naming</h2>
				One particular topic of interest I took in big numbers is their naming scheme.
				Most people are familiar with the smaller of the big number names, usually through economics: names like million, billion, and trillion.
				But once you get to a decillion, what comes after that?
				In the real world you wouldn't ever have to worry about numbers getting that large, and even in math and science where there are large numbers they just normalize them and multiply by an exponent (6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup>).
				Normalized numbers, however, are boring: they don't have any real weight that makes them impressive; <em>10<sup>12</sup> stars in the Andromeda galaxy</em> doesn't sound as good as <em>a trillion stars</em> and <em>6 x 10<sup>23</sup></em> doesn't sound as good as <em>six hundred sextillion</em>.
			</div>
			<div>
				This is why we leave the realm of bland scientific notation and enter into the world of ridiculous and impractical large number names.
				There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_large_numbers">systems for naming large numbers</a>, but the one I quite like is John H Conway's and Richard K Guy's system as defined in their book "<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Book_of_Numbers.html?id=0--3rcO7dMYC">The Book of Numbers</a>".
				Using Conway and Guy's system, one could properly identify the tresviginticentillisesquinquagintaquadringentillion (which is a 1 followed by 370'371 zeros).
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Groups</h3>
				At the core of naming numbers is the digit grouping.
				In the American English system we divide our big numbers into groups of three digits starting from the ones place.
				Usually these numbers are separated by commas (1,234,567) but I prefer to use apostrophes (1'234'567); just a matter of taste.
				Each of these groups is given a group-name: the group on the far right (1'234'<strong>567</strong>) has no group-name; the group to the left of that (1'<strong>234</strong>'567) has the group-name "Thousand"; the group to the left of <em>that</em> (<strong>1</strong>'234'567) has the group-name "Million"; etc.
				To get the name of a digit group, we use the name of the inner number and add the group-name after: the 234 in 1'234'567 becomes <em>two hundred thirty-four thousand</em>.
				To get the name of a big number, we take all the names for all the digit groups and string them together in order from biggest to smallest: 1'234'567 becomes <em>one million, two hundred thirty-four thousand, five hundred sixty-seven</em>.
			</div>
			<div>
				That was the basic system for converting a number from numerals to words, but you still don't know what comes after a decillion.
				Luckily, Conway and Guy's naming system works for any integer with any number of digits, long after decillions and centillions.
				For big numbers a digit group's group-name is based on its <em>group-number</em> which is, in layman's terms, one less than the number of three-digit groups after it.
				For example, 807'<strong>111</strong>'<strong>222</strong>'<strong>333</strong>'<strong>444</strong> has 4 three-digit groups after the 807, so the 807's group-number is 3, which corresponds to "trillion".
			</div>
			<div>
				More mathematically speaking, the group-number for a large number <em>M</em> is an integer <em>n</em> such that <span class="grouped">10<sup>3<em>n</em> + 3</sup> &le; <em>M</em></span> and <span class="grouped">10<sup>3(<em>n</em>+1) + 3</sup> &gt; <em>M</em>.</span>
				Million has the group-number 1 because 10<sup>3 + 3</sup> = 10<sup>6</sup> equals a million.
				From there, group-numbers follow a linear pattern: Billion has group-number 2, Trillion has 3, Quadrillion has 4, Octillion has 8, etc.
				Thousand is the only odd name since it doesn't end with 'illion' and its group-number is 0 <span class="grouped">(10<sup>0+3</sup> = 10<sup>3</sup></span> = 1'000).
				If you think it's odd there is a 3 being added in the exponent, blame Thousand: if Thousand didn't exist and one million was 1'000 and one billion was 1'000'000, then the group-number would just be the number of three-digit groups with no addition/subtraction mumbo-jumbo.
			</div>
			<div>
				You know how to get the group-number for any large number, now what?
				We will use the digits of the group-number and Latin prefixes to construct the group-name.
				Like we used the digits in groups of the big number to get the names of the digit groups, we use the digits in groups of the group-number to get the group-name associated with that group-number.
				It's all confusing with all this English but once you see the math it will be easier to understand.
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Constructing a Name</h3>
				The construction of a name uses the following table.
				I will explain all parts of the table and process as well as provide examples to ensure there is no confusion.
				First, observe the table.
				On the left are the digit values from 0 to 9 and to the right of them are the names for each digit if it was in the ones, tens, or hundreds spot.
